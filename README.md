USER INSTRUCTIONS:  

In BlueJ or a similar development environment, run ButtonsDisplayer1.java. Follow the prompts to generate a word cloud and/or citation. A text file has been provided already in the project folder ('Feynman Lectures.txt' -- the preface to the Feynman Lectures on Physics). 

If you have opted to make a word cloud, attach this file to reveal a word cloud summary of the core words of the text.  

If you have opted to make a citation, input the title 'Feynman Lectures on Physics,' author 'Richard Feynman, et al.,' date '1963,' and publisher 'Addison-Wesley.' You can save this citation in a text file. If you'd like to save it in the source text file, provide 'Feynman Lectures' as the file name. If you return to the source file, you will find the citation at the bottom of the file.

Now, you may make more word clouds and citations with other plain text files or quit.  

Happy citing!
